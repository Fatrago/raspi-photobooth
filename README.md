GoPro RasPi Photobox
=============

**GoPro RasPi Photobox: Use a GoPro connected with Raspberry Pi as a photobox.**  
  
This project uses ffmpeg, quick2wire-gpio-admin, nodejs, nginx and php.
You will see a live preview of your GoPro in your browserwindow. 
Add a Pulled-Up Button to RasPi's pin 7 (GPIO4) to use it as remote shutter.
